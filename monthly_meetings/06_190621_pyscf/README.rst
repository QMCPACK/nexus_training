Nexus Examples
==============

These examples illustrate basic usage of Nexus in the context of 
driving calculations of a single physical system at a time with 
PySCF and QMCPACK. A summary of the examples is given below.  


PySCF + QMCPACK Examples
------------------------
1. Performing a single restricted Hartree-Fock calculation with PySCF for a water molecule.
2. Performing a single RHF calculation in periodic BC's with PySCF: diamond primitive cell.
3. Performing VMC and DMC with QMCPACK for a water molecule, including RHF, orbital conversion, nuclear cusp correction, two- and three-body Jastrow optimization, and VMC/DMC.
4. Performing VMC and DMC with QMCPACK for a 2x1x1 tiled diamond supercell, including RHF, orbital conversion, two-body Jastrow optimization, and VMC/DMC.
